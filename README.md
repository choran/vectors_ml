## testing_vectors_operations.ipynb
This notebook is an altered version of the [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder.ipynb) on TensorFlow Hub which shows how to use the Universal Sentence Encoder for sentence similarity. <br>
So you can follow along the original notebook and make changes in that or just use this as a separate notebook or colab notebook. <br>
It contains examples of common operations you can perform on vectors in a Machine Learning context.

## vectors.ipynb
This notebook shows how we can visualize vectors in a 2d vector space

## house_price
This notebook shows how we can encode housr price data as an input vector

## fast_sentence_embeddings
This notebook shows how to generate sentence embeddings using a cool library that enables you to do this easily

## bowie_lyrics
This notebook contains an example of how we can use vectors to represent David Bowie lyrics as input to a Machine Learning model
